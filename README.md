# A friend for everyone

Chatting system to connect people with AI - Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

The core idea of this project is to use AI to help people suffering from loneliness. Our goal is to create a safe place where everyone could go and talk to an artifical intelligence that could become a friend of they. 


## Background

This project solve a problem that, alas, is becoming every day more frequent: the loneliness. It is weird that in a world where we're always connected to each other, this issue is constantly growing. It doesn't effect only old people which are deemed to be often isolated from everybody else, but also teenagers, for example bullied students or people who lost their family.


## How is it used?

The idea is very simple: a program or a website where everyone can log in and talk immediately to an immaginary person (our AI) that will converse with them and (hopefully) create a bond. When the user first sign up to the service the AI will know nothing about him but, as the time pass and with the two of them that will continue chatting, the AI would remember everything that has been said and calibrate the responses in order to sound like a human being.

## Data sources and AI methods
Where does your data come from? Do you collect it yourself or do you use data collected by someone else?
If you need to use links, here's an example:
[Twitter API](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs)

| Syntax      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Header      | Title       |
| Paragraph   | Text        |

## Challenges

This project is obviously not perfect and the limitations are clear. 
First of all, the AI program cannot substitute a real, physical friend. You could never encounter him, take a coffee together and talk face-to-face.
Besides that, some people could find this kind of friendship "unethical" due to the fact that you're not talking to a real person but to a computer whose only purpose is to satisfy you.

## What next?

The next step would be find a real friend somewhere in the world for the people using the AI based on how they talk to the intelligence, what their feelings and their interests are. With this method the AI would be only an intermediate step between the creation of a new solid friendship.

I did not use any material created from others. All you can see comes from my mind.
